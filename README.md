# Description
The Rubik's Cube project runs in a Python notebook and simulates the movements of a standard 3x3 cube.

It uses a class with methods that allow the below rotations in either clockwise or counter-clockwise movement:
- top rotation
- bottom rotation
- front rotation
- back rotation
- left rotation
- right rotation

A method was also created that allows to scramble the cube randomly depending on the number of moves specified by the user.

Lastly, a 2D visualization is also printed to show the current state of the cube on each of its faces after scrambling or after calling a specific method.
